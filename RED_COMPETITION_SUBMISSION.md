## ✍️ Artist Statement Template

**For RED Competition:**

```
My work explores the intersection of ancient dark mythology and digital corruption through algorithmic glitch art. In this RED series, I investigate red as the primordial color—blood, fire, death, power. 

Using custom algorithms (RGB channel manipulation, pixel sorting, data corruption), I fragment dark imagery and death deities into glitched transmissions saturated in crimson frequencies. Each piece exists in the space between perfection and decay, where red pulses through digital chaos.

Red represents the vital force—both life (blood) and death (decay). Through glitch aesthetics, I celebrate red's raw emotional power: rage, passion, hellfire, and the eternal darkness of the underworld painted in scarlet light.
